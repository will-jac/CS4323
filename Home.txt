Lexical Analysis = finite automata series
	- To construct, construct finite automata

Spend ~2.5 weeks to cover fundamental compiling concepts (ch 1, 2)
Then, we'll do Ch 3 (very long in book, but we will be skipping DFAs because we've taken ToC)
- Then, we'll know how to construct a lexical analyzer
*** First programming assignment


We'll be learning the theory at a very high level, and constructing a working compiler
