====== 5-Code Optimization ======
Created Thursday 23 January 2020

Transforms the intermediate code into more time / space effecient codes
* Global optimization 
	* Performs optimization considering it's effect over the entire source program
	* Uses data / control flow analysis evaluate effect
* Local optimization
	* Considers only small portions of the source program to improve code

Example: Peephole optimization
* Use a window of fixed size to optimize (eg optimize inside this frame)
* Tile windows throught program

Example: Go from 
R1 := C * 23
R2 := B + R1
A   := R2

To:
R1 := C * 23
A   := B + R1

Note that this is only useful if R2 is not elsewhere.
