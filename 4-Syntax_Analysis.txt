====== 4-Syntax Analysis ======
Created Thursday 30 January 2020

Two types: top down, bottom up

====== Top Down Parsing ======

Syntax analyzer does the majority syntax checking

Example:
L = { a^{n}b^{n} | n >= 0 }
has the pattern aa...bb
It is context-free but not regular, so it cannot be recognized by a DFA

* The language of all nested parentheses (or begin-ends) is not regular and therefore not context free
* Therefore, this pattern cannot be checked y the scanner and can be only done by the parser

Similarly, some language features cannot be described by context-free rules, so they cannot be checked by the parser, but can be done by the next level of the compiler (semantic analyzer)

Example:
L = { wzw | w ∈ {a,b}*, ie the language feature that identifies must be declared before use is not context free but is context-sensitive }
* checked by semantic analyzer

== Parse Trees and Derivations ==
Example:
E -> E + E | E * E | <id>
Derivations:
E 	=> E + E => E * E + 
	=> <id> * E + E
	=> <id> * <id> + E
	=> <id> * <id> + <id>
	
Begin = start symbol
Intermediate = sentential forms
Last form = sentence (only terminals)
Sequence = derivation

Can subscript the arrows to indicate that it is a left-most derivation
=>_{lm}

**Given a derivation, there exist exactly one tree**
**Given a tree, there are many possible derivations that generate that tree**
	**However, only one left-most derivation exists**


Top down = left most
Bottom up = right most

== Ambiguity ==
Def:
A CFG is ambiguous if there are multple parse trees for some terminal string.

CFG ambiguity is undecidable

Strategy:
For specific CFG, write everything you can as a right-linear grammar, then it's easy to analyze the few rules that can't be expressed this way.
If it is right-linear, it's not ambiguous (??  - not sure about this)

Generally, you can transform most things from an ambiguous set of rules to a non-ambiguous set of rules

== Disambiguation ==

EG: * > + (multiplication has a higher priority than multiplication)
E -> E + T | T
T -> T * F | F
F -> <id>

Now, it's non-ambiguous

keywords: begin, if, int
identifiers: seq of english chars
constants: seq of digits (possibly including decimal)
special symbols: : , =

====== Deterministic Parsing ======
There are two well-known "Universal Context-Free" deterministic parsing methods
1. CYK (Cocke-Younger-Kasami) or Earley's algoritm
	a. Can handle any CFL in O(n^3) time
2. Top-Down (LL) and Bottom-Up (LR) parsing algorithms
	a. can handle large subclasses of CFLs in O(n) time

===== CYK =====
Given a CFG G = (N, Σ, P, S) in CNF, and an input string w ∈ Σ* , decide if w ∈ L(G)

Note: in CNF (Chomsky Normal Form), each rule either maps to a single terminal or two non-terminals, which means that the parse tree is always binary (!)

Work bottom-up - every terminal symbol MUST come from a terminal symbol, so consider all possible ways to generate a symbol, eg:
A -> c
B -> c
and combine them in all possible ways

Time: O(n^{2 }* n * |N|^{2}) = O(n^{3})
|N| = length of N rules?

===== Top-Down Parsing =====
Given a CFG G and a string W, construct a parse tree for w in G top-down, ie start with the start symbol of G and EXPAND nonterminals in order to generate w.

EXPAND:
Given any non-terminal A, choose one of it's productions to expand and follow it.
How do we determine which one to expand?
